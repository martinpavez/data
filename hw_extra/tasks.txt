TASKS by 02/17:

- Clean notebooks using built classes
- Complete classes for yearly frequency (features and predictions)
- Use t2m data for using land boxes
- Gather best results for prediction (specially Cross Validated)


- Use latitude as feature (max presssure in the region)
- Incorporate ENSO indices / Ocean indices to see model performance

Experiments:
- Reproduce again using CV=10, this is coherent to predict 5 years
- Include CV MAPE metric
- Explore other metrics, feature selections.


Github:
- Check ENSO indices and build the integration into the github 
- ENSO is: Clean data (download missing) (01 to 02 kedro), hourly to monthly (02 to 03), apply parameters (static/sliding climatology, how much rolling?, std??)
