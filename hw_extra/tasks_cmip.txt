Notes on CMIP models:

On cluster we have:
    SP
        scenarios: ssp126, ssp245, ssp585
        models: daily for ESM1.2 High Resolution 
        dates: 2015-2100
        grid: gn
    TA (ta at level)
        scenarios: ""
        models: 6hrlev (with elevation idk level??) for ESM1.2 High Resolution
        dates: ""
        grid: gn
    TAS (surface 2m)
        scenarios: historical, picontrol, ssp119, ssp126, ssp245, ssp370, ssp585
        models: 3hr GFDL-ESM4 
        dates: historical 1850-2015, ssp 2015-2100
        grid: gr1
    U-wind:
        scenaris: 126,245,285
        models: daily MPI-ESM1.2HR
        dates: 2015-2100
        grid:gn

Usually models are INSTITUTE-MODEL-RESOLUTION 
6hr standard
6hrLev at model levels (altitude levels)
6hrPlev pressure levels (e.g. 850hPa)
plevs: https://cmip6dr.github.io/Data_Request_Home/Documents/CMIP6_pressure_levels.pdf
    basically if we need 850hpa, we need plev3, plev4(4s), plev5, plev8, plev10, plev11, plev19, plev23, plev27, plev39

Two models: GFDL-ESM4 and MPI-ESM1.2 HR

grids:
gn: native grid of the model component
gr: regridded to the regular target grid specified for the particular variable
gr1: another target grid 

MPI-ESM1.2HR, r1i1p1f1 has both 100km or 50km grids
    historical:
        daily has tos(sst), tas, tasmax, ua, psl
        monthly has ""
    ssp 126, 245, 370, 585
        same

GFDL-ESM4, r1i1p1f1 100km grids
    historical:
        daily  has tos, tas, tasmax, ua, psl
        monthly  ""
    ssps:
        daily has everything except for ua (only uas). only ssp585 has this variable
        monthly has everything

EC-EARTH3, r1i1p1f1, 100km grids
    historical and ssps have everything.

Update library script for download CMIP6 data  

Visualize some of the historical model vs era5, maybe construct the simplest index (like wind) and visualize how much they differ. 
Remember grid is not the same always, so interpolation in small boxes could differ.

Review how much do drivers differ cmip6 vs era5
construct cmip6 raw to intermediate to standarize data: coordinates, units, nans. Path organize just 01_raw.
