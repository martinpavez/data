    "After succeding in reproducing Indices, we explore the linear correlation between MEI and HW's, next the personal-specified variants of MEI (MEI in whole world, specific boxes, using more than first mode, using different variables). Everything points that there is an underlying pattern because some combinations between the parameters showed high absolute correlations for some seasons. \n",
